# AI-Enhanced 6G Positioning & Mapping

## Project Overview

The rapid expansion of wireless coverage and advancements in telecommunications have enabled the widespread application of various location-based services. However, the cornerstone of these services is the continuous tracking of precise physical locations, a challenging task in indoor environments. Scholars have endeavored to develop a multitude of techniques and algorithms for indoor positioning systems. Yet, accuracy, scalability, and adaptability remain significant hurdles for their widespread deployment. A predominant factor in the challenge of implementing these mapping systems in indoor environments is the unpredictable nature of wave propagation in varied indoor settings, alongside the limitations of remote access technologies.

The advent of Sixth Generation (6G) mobile communication systems proposes a plethora of applications where user location and positioning, as well as environment mapping, are crucial, such as digital twins, intelligent surfaces, and more. This project aims to explore techniques and tools for data acquisition and processing in indoor environments with the intention of employing them to train Artificial Intelligence (AI) capable of digitally and automatically mapping movement within an indoor space using Python.

## Objectives

- To study and develop techniques for acquiring and processing data in indoor environments.
- To utilize AI to map indoor movements accurately and automatically.
